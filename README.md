## Features

## Approach

We tackled the backend first, as the main backend functionality of a MERN CRUD app is similar, such as the express server logic and the react routes that would interact with the express CRUD routes.

Majority of this project was done via pair coding with input and suggestions, with task assignment and communication through slack

## Installation dependencies

This app requires external api keys from the following

- Google Cloud
- Cloudinary
- Mongo DB
