## Features

## Approach

We tackled the backend first, as the main backend functionality of a MERN CRUD app is similar, such as the express server logic and the react routes that would interact with the express CRUD routes.
</br>
Majority of this project was done via pair coding with input and suggestions, with task assignment and communication through slack

## Installation dependencies

This app requires external api keys from the following

- Google Cloud
- Cloudinary
- Mongo DB

## Unresolved Issues

Theres no way to contact the poster, potential sketch goal is a messaging system Route that can belong to the user,
The CSS can be futher fine tuned, as theres mismatches in sizing

## Wireframe

We used Balsamiq as out wireframing tool
